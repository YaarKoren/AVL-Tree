<h2>Description</h2>
Implemention of AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree . <br />
Each element of the tree has a key which is integer, and a value (or info) which is string. All keys are different from each other, the order of the tree nodes is determined by the keys.  <br />
There is a detailed documentation in Hebrew, explaining the implemention, the different methods and their runtime complexity. The documentation also contains experiments performed on the data structure and analysis of running times.
